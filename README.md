#COMSW3101 Fall 2016 Final Project: Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Project Dependencies
+ json: used for parsing data.
+ [matplotlib](www.matplotlib.org): used for creating charts.
+ [TextBlob](http://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/index.html): used for sentiment analysis of Tweets.
+ [Tweepy](www.tweepy.org): used for accessing Twitter API.


#### Installation (OSX):
To install these libraries for Python 3, type 'pip3 install [name]'.


## Extensions
Tapping into Twitter geo-data would add rich insights to the visualizations. For example, as it pertains to the U.S. elections, average sentiment of candidates or political topics could be overlaid onto a US map by state.
